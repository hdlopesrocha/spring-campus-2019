              <br>Audio nodes are linked via their inputs and outputs, forming a chain that starts with one or more sources, goes through one or more nodes, then ends up at a destination.
              <br><br>A simple, typical workflow for web audio would look something like this:
              <ul>
                <li>Create the audio context.</li>
                <li>Inside the context, create sources â€” such as < audio >, oscillator, or stream.</li>
                <li>Create effects nodes, such as reverb, biquad filter, panner, or compressor.</li>
                <li>Choose the final destination for the audio, such as the user's computer speakers.</li>
                <li>Establish connections from the audio sources through zero or more effects, eventually ending at the chosen destination.</li>
              </ul>
